Philsophy is a discipline and a way of life. This is especially true for some philosphers. One of the most stunning examples of this is Diogenes of Sinope.
There are several famous anecdotes about the life of this philospher. One is a story of his meeting with Alexander the Great. Ever defiant of societal expectations, Diogenes lived in a Barell, leading an extremely ascetic life. Alexander heard tales of an eccentric philosopher and wanted to meet him in person. Ancient Greek historian Diogenes Laertius in his famous work"Lives of Eminent Philosophers" relates the results of the meeting:
Alexander came and stood over him and said, "Ask of me any boon you like." To which he replied, "Stand out of my light."

Diogenes was no stranger to controversy, believing that virtue is better expressed on action than theoritized about, he was a true practitioner of his beliefs.

One of the purely philosophical controversies Diogenes got into was about the nature of man. Athenina native Plato defined man as "Featherless biped" This amused Diogenes as in accordance with this definition he presented plucked chicken as an example of Plato's man.
Other eccentric deed of Diogenes is his search for "an hones man": in the middle of the day he walked through Athens with a lit lantern trying to find one, the task was so hard that even lit lantern dif not allow to see one honest man in ancient Athens.
